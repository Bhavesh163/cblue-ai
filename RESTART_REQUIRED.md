# ⚠️ RESTART REQUIRED

## The code has been updated but you're seeing old responses

### Why?
The API service loads the knowledge base into memory when it starts. Your changes won't appear until you restart the service.

## How to Restart

### Option 1: Restart API Service
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Cblue\ +\ customer\ support/cblue-ai

# Stop the API
pkill -f "python.*services/api/main.py"

# Start the API
cd services/api
python main.py
```

### Option 2: Use the restart script
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Cblue\ +\ customer\ support/cblue-ai
./stop_services.sh
./start_services.sh
```

### Option 3: Quick restart (if running in terminal)
Press `Ctrl+C` to stop, then run again:
